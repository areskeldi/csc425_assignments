Question 2: there is a total of 7960 MB of installed memory in my system. 6506 MB of those is free unused memory. The numbers did not match my intuition.
Question 4: When the program is running, the total free memory changed from 6352 MB to 6331 MB.
When the program is killed, the used memory gets back to its original state (meaning whatever MB I gave
as an argument are substracted from the last checked used memory). 
Question 6: I got the process ID to check with pmap by using the ps auxw to see the list of all processes.
I got the process ID by looking at the second column on the table ('PID').
Question 7: I see a row called Total KB, and several columns like KBytes, RSS, Dirty Mode, and Mapping.
Question 8: As the argument gets bigger for ./memory-user, the bigger will be the numbers when running
the pmap for the process ID of ./memory-user
